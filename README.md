# hdvecs

A Clojure library implementing computation with high dimensional vectors.

## Background

Current implementation based on Tony Plate's *Holographic Reduced Representations* (IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 1995).

Planned second implementation based on Pentti Kanerva's *Hyperdimensional Computing* (Cognitive Computation, 2009).
